This is a note for some coding stuff so I don't have to look this back up

Its like a notebook :)



/////////FOR LOOP/////////////

runs code a curtain amount of times


                 runs 11 times

 	
 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
   number starts 
	           when this is meet it nolonger runs
			            after running the code this increases the number and then the code runs agian
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) 
{

}




///////DEBUG MESSAGE////?////////



 runs a debug message to the debug output
show_debug_message("this is a test duh")




////////Random stuff///////////

all genarate a random number from 0 to the number put in

makes a random number with decimals so 22.567532 can show up
random(number goes here)


same but only whole numbers so no decimals (way better)
irandom(number goes here)
